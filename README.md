## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Full Stack developer and aspiring competitive programmer! Your're very welcome to check my journey from not knowing to code in 2022, developing my first simple HTML + CSS pages at the beginning of 2023, to working on Full Stack projects using React.js, Next.js, PrismaORM, Nest.js, PostgesSQL, MongoDB, Tailwind, Styled-components, Express, Axios, Typescript (... the list goes on) and currently a top 7% programmer at CodeWars (where I solve the problemns using C++)!
